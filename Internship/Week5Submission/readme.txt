We created a three-tier architecture on Azure, consisting of Web, App, and DB tiers. Each tier has its own subnet within a Virtual Network (VNet). Network Security Groups (NSGs) were configured for each subnet to control traffic flow: the Web tier NSG allows internet traffic for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and RDP, and communicates with the App tier; the App tier NSG allows traffic from the Web tier and communicates with the DB tier; the DB tier NSG restricts access to only the App tier. Appropriate VMs (Linux and Windows) were deployed in each tier, configured with Apache and IIS respectively. Attached are the topology diagrams and screenshots of the configuration.
