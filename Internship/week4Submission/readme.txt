This script helps set up the networking stuff in Azure that our virtual machines need.  It gives the VM's network interface a static IP address so it doesn't change and  then it makes a Network Security Group to control access.  It also sets up a public IP address and connects it to the network interface.  Last, it builds a new network interface with all these things.  The script uses Azure CLI so everything happens fast and gets set up the right way.  It checks if things already exist before changing them so it doesn't break anything.  Doing it this way makes setting up the network easy and keeps our VMs secure following Azure best practices. There are screenshots attatched and the script is there as well
